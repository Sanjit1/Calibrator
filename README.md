Use this app to Calibrate your thermistor online!

If you are here from scioly, you cannot use it during competition, because internet is not allowed, and this needs internet, so I would suggest using my [java version](https://www.github.com/Sanjit1/CalibratorJava) which has a [jar release](https://www.github.com/Sanjit1/CalibratorJava/releases) which you can download.
